My name is Harkirat Rakhraj, Recent Graduate of Ivey Business School's Master of Science in Digital Management and I am the founder of LocAIly. As a fellow London-based professional and recent graduate with a Master of Science in Digital Management from Ivey Business School, I believe there’s an excellent opportunity to enhance your internal efficiency through secure, locally hosted AI solutions.

Many organizations hesitate to adopt AI due to valid concerns about sensitive data leakage—particularly when utilizing external services like Google, Microsoft, or DeepSeek. To address this, I provide a secure and fully private solution where advanced Large Language Models (LLMs)—including Meta’s LLaMA, Google’s Gemma, Microsoft's Phi, and DeepSeek—are locally hosted, customized, and fine-tuned specifically to your organization's needs, ensuring your confidential data never leaves your premises.

Benefits Specifically for Clients

    Data Security and Privacy: No risk of data leaks to external providers, ensuring your information stays secure and confidential.
    Customized and Fine-Tuned: AI models specifically adapted to match your organization's processes, terminology, and industry requirements.
    Cost Predictability: One-time upfront pricing based clearly on the number of concurrent users and required GPU infrastructure, without hidden fees.

To best tailor this solution to your needs, could you share an estimate of how many employees currently work on-premises at your organization, and how many of them might concurrently access such an AI tool?

I’m currently scheduling short calls next week to discuss this further, and I would be happy to reserve a convenient time slot for you. Simply reply to this email with your availability or any preliminary questions you might have.

Thanks very much—I look forward to potentially collaborating to enhance your organization's operations.


Warm regards,
